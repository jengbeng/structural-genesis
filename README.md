# Structural Genesis — Ø₀ Document

This repository contains the fundamental **Ø₀ Document**, which describes the
minimal possible structure required for the emergence of distinctions,
stability, subjectivity, ensemble coordination, and the conditions under which
structure can reach its limits and collapse.

The architecture of Structural Genesis:

Ø₀ → θ₁–θ₈ → Δ₀ → S₀ → Sₙ → X → Ø₀

The document is self-contained and does not require additional files.  
Its purpose is to provide a minimal and universal formal framework for
understanding structural emergence and dissolution across any domain.

See **Ø0.md** for the complete specification (English version).  
See **Ø0_ru.md** for the Russian translation.
